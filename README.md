## Description

The following script is based on AppleScript and Javascript intended to allow to tamper with information, specifically the process name and bundle identifier of an application. Through the activity monitor, we can obtain the PID of the process we would like to exploit. With that PID, we can then enter it into the GUI of the executable version of the script. From there, we can view information such as the `lsappinfo` and see the process has indeed been modified; we can also tamper the bundle identifier if needed. Proceeding with the changes, we can confirm by going to the application itself or checking the activity monitor once again, confirming the core of the process has been tampered with while it is in an active state. If the process is killed, the changes will revert back. The following exploit can be utilized for OS restrictive bypasses, and furthermore, can be utilized for redirecting of bundle identifiers. In addition, the exploit can be utilized for process name hijacking to a victim's application by invoking certain functionalities within the script.
